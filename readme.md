# This is the main site for CS 633 Unit Testing

## These links will allow you to remix existing (working) projects that include examples of unit testing.

**The first 2 examples use Moch-Chai to test an algorithm that implements the 'winning' logic for the classic game Rock-Paper-Scissors given two inputs**

The first example runs in the browser.  Once you have remixed the project you should play with the tests to make one fail.  You should also play with the algoritm and make all the tests fail.  Sometime we can write the tests first knowing they should all fail and then write the logic one by one to make them pass.  
  
In the second example you will see how much 'coverage' the tests provide the code.  

Don't be scared to mess up the tests or the code.  Once you remix the project it is your personal playground and if something gets messed up you can come back to this page and start fresh.  
  
Hope you have fun!
