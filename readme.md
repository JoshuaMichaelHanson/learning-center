# This is the main site for CS 633 Unit Testing

## These links will allow you to fork existing (working) projects that include examples of unit testing.

**The first 2 examples use Mocha-Chai to test an algorithm that implements the 'winning' logic for the 
classic game Rock-Paper-Scissors given two inputs**

Once you fork the projects click the 'code' button do clone locally OR setup a GitHub codespace online
environment.  Every GitHub account can create online codespace environments to write and run source code.

The first example runs in the browser. You should play with the tests to make one fail.  You should also 
play with the algorithm and make all the tests fail.  Sometimes we can write the tests first knowing they 
should all fail and then write the logic one by one to make them pass.  

In the second example you will see how much 'coverage' the tests provide the code.  

Don't be scared to mess up the tests or the code.  Once you forked the project it is your personal playground 
and if something gets messed up you can re-clone or set up a new codespace environment.
  
Hope you have fun!
